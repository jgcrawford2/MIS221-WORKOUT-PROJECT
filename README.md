# MIS221-WORKOUT-PROJECT
This is my bonus project for MIS221! :) Enjoy!
I missed the last week entirely to work on this project
Unfortunately I caught strep, flu, and had many fevers throughout the span of the week leading up to this submission.
I am glad I got it done for MIS221 though and hope someone will find the use cases throughout for this project.
Struggles:
1) The API was miserable to work with, I was unfamiliar with all the "using System.(etc)'s" that I needed to add at the beginning
2) Again on the API section, using the API Key was pretty miserable, it took me awhile to figure this out
3) Again on the API section, whenever I would pull an API request to the terminal, it was an absolutely MASSIVE block, learning to space this out was not easy and I had to learn how to use JsonDocument and JsonElement.
Successes:
1) Most of this code made a ton of sense to me from the get go, I made a lot of UI changes throughout that I was really happy with
2) Some of the work was just repetitive and straightforward. such as logging, adding exercises/cardio/weight/etc, removals, and the cases with switch(choices).
3) A lot of Console.WriteLines and Console.Write's, it was a success because these are easy to work with and not miserable
4) Overall not a ton of issues with the rest of the code and very simple to make the changes I wanted to!

Thanks for the semester lots of love from Jay and thanks for always being accomodating to me throughout and helping me grow.
